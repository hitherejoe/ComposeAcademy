Compose Academy is a free resource that provides snippets and practical samples on how to use Jetpack Compose for the Android platform.

## Still work in progress 🚧

Whilst the site is live, the current catalog is minimal - enough to get started in playing with compose. I will be adding new things quite often

## Coming soon - the book and tutorial videos 📰

I'm currently writing a book on jetpack compose, based off of compose academy but the writings will be much more in depth. Once the APIs for compose are stable (and close to final), I will be creating a video course too. The best way to be aware of when these are available is to [sign-up to my newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/648900712412/signup_exploring_mobile_development).

## Contributions ✍️

I'm not currently accepting contributions to this repository. My writings for a lot of the API are already work-in-progress, but in future I will be considering opening this up for help!
